# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this project was to help PLANMYTRIP who specialize in providing customers with hotel and logding services through their online website. For their front-end website, the ultimate goal was to collect and present data via the search page, which customers would then filter based on their preferrd travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel anywhere in the world. To succeed in this task Jupyter Notebook was used along with the citypy module to generate 2000 random longitudes and latitudes. Then requests were made to the open weather map API and retrieve the JSON weather data for the cities. The weather data was added to a pandas DataFrame containing various weather criteria's. Then the dataframe was cleaned and used to choose the best cities to book a hotel based on the temperature of the city. Then the hotels in these cities were mapped in jupyter gmaps google places API with the name of the city, weather, and hotel name displayed in the info boxes. Furthermore, the customer also could shortlist 4 cities from the list of potential travel destinations based on their city temperature critera. And finally the Google Maps directions API was utilized to create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
